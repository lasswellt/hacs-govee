    Platform Setup:
    1. Retrieve coordinator and devices from runtime data
    2. Create light entities for devices that support lighting
    3. Create segment entities for RGBIC devices with segment control
    4. Register Govee-specific services (segment control, music mode)

    Entity Creation:
    - Light entities created for devices with DEVICE_TYPE_LIGHT
    - Also created for any device with on/off capability (smart plugs with lights)
    - Segment entities created for RGBIC devices (e.g., H6199, H6160)
    - Each entity gets full capability detection and color mode setup
