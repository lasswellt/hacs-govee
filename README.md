---

## Features & Usage

### Light Control

Light entities support standard Home Assistant light controls:

- **On/Off** - Turn lights on or off
- **Brightness** - Adjust brightness (0-100%)
- **Color** - Set RGB color
- **Color Temperature** - Set warm/cool white temperature
- **Effects** - Select from available scenes (if supported)

### Scene Selection

For devices with many scenes, a **Select** entity is created:

- **Scene** - Dynamic scenes from Govee cloud
- **DIY Scene** - Your custom DIY scenes (disabled by default)

To enable DIY scenes:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Govee**
2. Click on your device
3. Find the "DIY Scene" entity and enable it

**Scene State Tracking:**
- Scenes use optimistic state tracking (the API doesn't report current scene)
- When you select a scene, the selection is remembered locally
- If you manually change brightness, color, or color temperature, the scene selection clears (indicating manual control)
- Scene state persists across Home Assistant restarts

### Segment Control

RGBIC strips support individual segment control via services:

```yaml
# Set segments 0-4 to red
service: govee.set_segment_color
target:
  entity_id: light.govee_led_strip
data:
  segments: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  rgb_color: [255, 0, 0]
```

### Night Light Mode

Some Govee devices (like the H601F recessed lighting) support a Night Light mode that activates a warm, dim backlight. For these devices, a separate **Switch** entity is created:

- **Night Light** - Toggle switch to enable/disable night light mode

The night light switch appears automatically for supported devices and can be controlled like any Home Assistant switch - via the UI, automations, or voice assistants.

### Music Mode

Activate music-reactive modes on supported devices:

```yaml
service: govee.set_music_mode
target:
  entity_id: light.govee_led_strip
data:
  mode: "Energic"
  sensitivity: 80
  auto_color: true
```

### Group Device Support (Experimental)

Govee Home app groups (SameModeGroup, BaseGroup, DreamViewScenic) have limited API support:
- ✅ **Discovery**: Groups appear in device list
- ✅ **Control**: On/off commands work perfectly
- ❌ **State queries**: API returns "devices not exist" error

**How It Works:**
- Groups use **assumed state** (showing separate On/Off buttons instead of toggle)
- State is tracked optimistically based on commands you send via Home Assistant
- State persists across Home Assistant restarts using RestoreEntity
- Groups remain "available" and controllable even though state cannot be queried
- Actual device state may differ if controlled outside Home Assistant (Govee app, voice assistants, etc.)

**To Enable:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Govee**
2. Click **Configure**
3. Enable **"Enable Group Devices"**
4. Restart Home Assistant

**Recommendation:** For the most reliable state tracking, control individual devices directly rather than using Govee Home app groups. Groups are best used when you need to control multiple similar devices simultaneously and don't mind potential state drift.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot connect" error during setup**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure your Govee account has API access enabled

**Devices not appearing**
- Only cloud-enabled devices appear in the API
- Bluetooth-only devices are not supported
- Govee Home app groups (SameModeGroup, BaseGroup, DreamViewScenic) are skipped by default
  - **Experimental:** Enable in **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Govee** > **Configure**
  - ✅ **Control commands work** (on/off supported)
  - ❌ **State queries fail** ("devices not exist" - uses assumed state instead)
  - Groups will show as "unavailable" in UI but commands will still work
- Try refreshing the integration

**State not updating**
- Increase the poll interval if you have many devices
- Some devices don't support state queries (assumed state is used)

**Rate limit errors**
- The API has limits: 100 requests/minute, 10,000/day
- Increase your poll interval
- Reduce the number of automations calling Govee services

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.govee: debug
```

Then restart Home Assistant and check **Settings** > **System** > **Logs**.

### Disable Attribute Updates (Advanced)

If API returns incorrect state for specific attributes, you can disable them:

1. Go to **Govee** integration options
2. In "Disable Attribute Updates", enter: `API:power_state`
3. Format: `SOURCE:attribute` where SOURCE is `API` or `HISTORY`
4. Multiple: `API:power_state;HISTORY:online`

> **Warning:** This is a workaround. Report the underlying issue.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

This integration is classified as a **Hub** integration (`integration_type: hub`) because it connects to the Govee cloud service which manages multiple devices.

**Key Components:**
- **Cloud API Integration**: Uses Govee API v2.0 for all device communication
- **Data Update Coordinator**: Manages periodic state polling and caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforces API limits (100 requests/minute, 10,000/day)
- **Platforms**: Light, Switch, Select (scene selection)

### Auto-Discovery

**Auto-discovery is not applicable** for this integration due to its cloud-only architecture:

- **Requires API Key**: The Govee API v2.0 requires user authentication via API key from the Govee Developer Portal
- **No Local Discovery**: Govee devices communicate exclusively through the cloud; there are no local discovery protocols (SSDP, Zeroconf, mDNS)
- **Cloud Authentication**: Device discovery requires authenticated API requests, which can only be performed after user provides their API key

This is by design and acceptable for cloud-polling integrations per Home Assistant's quality scale guidelines. Auto-discovery is only feasible for integrations with local network discovery capabilities.

### Code Quality

This integration follows Home Assistant 2025.12 best practices:
- **100% Type Annotations**: Full mypy strict mode compliance
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 526 tests with 99.78% coverage
- **Async Architecture**: Fully asynchronous implementation
- **Modern Python**: Uses Python 3.12+ features and type syntax

Share this file when reporting issues for faster resolution.

### Repair Issues

The integration creates repair issues in Home Assistant to proactively warn you about potential problems:

| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Group Device Limitation** | Warning | Appears when group devices are enabled. Explains that control works but state queries fail due to Govee API limitations. |
| **Per-Minute Rate Limit** | Warning | Appears when approaching the 100 requests/minute limit. Suggests increasing poll interval. |
| **Daily Rate Limit** | Warning | Appears when approaching the 10,000 requests/day limit. More urgent - recommends immediate action. |

To view repair issues:
1. Go to **Settings** > **System** > **Repairs**
2. Click on any Govee-related issues for detailed information and recommendations

These warnings auto-clear when the underlying condition resolves (e.g., rate limit resets).
